    <p>
      You can either use the precompiled libraries from
      <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download.php">
        the SDL Download web site </a
      >, or you can build SDL yourself.
    </p>
    <h3>Building SDL</h3>
    <p>
      Go into the VisualC directory and double-click on the Visual Studio
      solution for your version of Visual Studio, e.g.
      <code>SDL_VS2008.sln</code> This should open up the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different solution files for the various versions of the IDE.
      Please use the appropriate version 2008, 2010, 2012 or 2013.
    </p>
    <p>Build the <code>.dll</code> and <code>.lib</code> files.</p>
    <p>
      This is done by right clicking on each project in turn (Projects are
      listed in the Workspace panel in the FileView tab), and selecting "Build".
    </p>
    <p>
      You may get a few warnings, but you should not get any errors. You do have
      to have at least the DirectX 9 SDK installed, however. The latest version
      of DirectX can be downloaded from
      <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, we will refer to the following .lib and .dll files that have just
      been generated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SDL2.dll</li>
      <li>SDL2.lib</li>
      <li>SDL2main.lib</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Search for these using the Windows Find (Windows-F) utility inside the
      VisualC directory.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating a Project with SDL</h3>
    <p>Create a project as a Win32 Application.</p>
    <p>Create a C++ file for your project.</p>
    <p>
      Set the C runtime to "Multi-threaded DLL" in the menu:
      <code>Project|Settings|C/C++ tab|Code Generation|Runtime Library </code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add the SDL <code>include</code> directory to your list of includes in the
      menu:
      <code
        >Project|Settings|C/C++ tab|Preprocessor|Additional include directories
      </code>
      .
      <br />
      <strong
        ><font color="#009900"
          >VC7 Specific: Instead of doing this I find it easier to add the
          include and library directories to the list that VC7 keeps. Do this by
          selecting Tools|Options|Projects|VC++ Directories and under the "Show
          Directories For:" dropbox select "Include Files", and click the "New
          Directory Icon" and add the [SDLROOT]\include directory (e.g. If you
          installed to c:\SDL\ add c:\SDL\include).&nbsp;Proceed to&nbsp;change
          the dropbox selection to "Library Files" and add [SDLROOT]\lib.</font
        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The "include directory" I am referring to is the
      <code>include</code> folder within the main SDL directory (the one that
      this HTML file located within).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we're going to use the files that we had created earlier in the Build
      SDL step.
    </p>
    <p>Copy the following files into your Project directory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SDL2.dll</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Add the following files to your project (It is not necessary to copy them
      to your project directory):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SDL2.lib</li>
      <li>SDL2main.lib</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (To add them to your project, right click on your project, and select "Add
      files to project")
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        ><font color="#009900"
          >Instead of adding the files to your project it is more desirable to
          add them to the linker options: Project|Properties|Linker|Command Line
          and type the names of the libraries to link with in the "Additional
          Options:" box.&nbsp; Note: This must be
          done&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;build configuration (e.g.
          Release,Debug).</font
        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <h3>SDL 101, First Day of Class</h3>
    <p>
      Now create the basic body of your project. The body of your program should
      take the following form:
    </p>

    <pre><CODE>
#include "SDL.h"

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
  // Body of the program goes here.
  return 0;
}
			</CODE></PRE>
    <p></p>
    <h3>That's it!</h3>
    <p>
      I hope that this document has helped you get through the most difficult
      part of using the SDL: installing it. Suggestions for improvements to this
      document should be sent to the writers of this document.

      port.
